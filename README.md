# Monte Carlo Simulation of the Premier League based on Modelling Goals Scored

## Introduction
This is a data-driven project that uses statistical analysis, machine learning techniques, and Monte-Carlo simulation to forecast Premier League match outcomes. We have then compared the season results along with the estimated probabilities of each fixture's possible results with the Bet365 probabilities. This README provides a comprehensive explanation of the project's objectives, methods, data sources, model specifics, and usage instructions.

## Project Overview

The **Premier League** stands as one of the globe's most illustrious football leagues, known for its competitive nature and intense matchups. The primary goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that uses different features of the teams to forecast the rate parameter that is used to model the goals scored by the home and away teams in a fixture and simulate those fixtures to factor in the randomness and uncertainty that are involved in football matches.
